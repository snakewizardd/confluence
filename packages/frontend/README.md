The interface with consciousness - where data becomes perception.

## Philosophy

This is not a dashboard. This is a window into the harmony of systems.
Through visualizations rendered with mathematical precision (D3, Three.js),
through generative soundscapes (Tone.js), through reactive interfaces (Next.js),
we perceive the unity beneath apparent multiplicity.

## Structure

```
src/
├── app/              # Pages - the views of consciousness
├── components/       # Reusable elements - the building blocks
├── lib/              # Utilities - the tools of perception
└── styles/           # Aesthetics - beauty as truth
```

## Run

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The system breathes on port 3000.
